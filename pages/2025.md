KaiCode is an annual open source festival,
started in [2015](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html).

This is how it works: First, you submit your open-source repository to us.
Then, our jury will review it. If your repository wins, we give you
a monetary reward and a laurel badge that you can attach to your
[README file][readme].

In order to get into the competition, your repository must be:

* Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Larger than 4,000 [SLOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code)
* Older than 12 months (since the first commit)
* Younger than 60 months (since the first commit)
* Not yet a winner of KaiCode

To win, your repository must demonstrate the highest
quality of code and development processes.
In particular, the jury pays attention to the following
(in no particular order):

* Clean code
* Design choices
* [Coding conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) control
* [Static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)
* [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
* [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)
* [Code coverage control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)
* [Requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering)
* Documentation
* [Git branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
* [Bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system)
and [issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system) tracking
* [Code reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)
* [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
* [Releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle)
and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
* [Licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license)

This doesn't matter:

* How popular is your product?
* What programming languages do you use?
* What is the license?
* What is the programming paradigm (OOP, FP, etc.)?

One GitHub user may submit only one project.

Neither jury members nor festival organizers are
allowed to submit their projects.

We reserve the right to reject any submission without an explanation.
