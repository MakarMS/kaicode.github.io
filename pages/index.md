Our [first kaicode meetup](https://kaicode.timepad.ru/event/1340101/) (16th of July) had found our guests! We decided to invite well-known project [Tarantool](https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool) to our meetup. This project is a good example of how huge companies like mail.ru group can collaborate with open source community. Tarantool will be represented by [Sergey Ostanevich](https://github.com/sergos) and [Kirill Yukhin](https://github.com/kyukhin).
Sergey Ostanevich - software architect at Mail.ru. Sergos is an engineer with more than 20 years of experience, before Mail.ru he worked at Intel and Samsung. Kirill Yukhin is an engineering team lead at Mail.ru. Kirill has big experience in the development of optimizing compilers. He was teaching in MIPT and before Mail.ru Kirill more than 10 years worked at Intel.

The [first meetup](https://kaicode.timepad.ru/event/1340101/) will happen on the 16th of July in Moscow.
We are thinking about the first guest. If you know someone
awesome with their own open source projects,
[send them](https://t.me/kaicode_org) our way.

from Huawei (around $5,000).
