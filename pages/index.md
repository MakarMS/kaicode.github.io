Our [first kaicode meetup](https://kaicode.timepad.ru/event/1340101/) (16th of July) had found our guests! We decided to invite well-known project [Tarantool](https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool) to our meetup. This project is a good example of how huge companies like mail.ru group can collaborate with open source community. Tarantool will be represented by [Sergey Ostanevich](https://github.com/sergos) and [Kirill Yukhin](https://github.com/kyukhin).
Sergey Ostanevich - software architect at Mail.ru. Sergos is an engineer with more than 20 years of experience, before Mail.ru he worked at Intel and Samsung. Kirill Yukhin is an engineering team lead at Mail.ru. Kirill has big experience in the development of optimizing compilers. He was teaching in MIPT and before Mail.ru Kirill more than 10 years worked at Intel.

The [first meetup](https://kaicode.timepad.ru/event/1340101/) will happen on the 16th of July in Moscow.
We are thinking about the first guest. If you know someone
awesome with their own open source projects,
[send them](https://t.me/kaicode_org) our way.

<ins>18 Jun 2020</ins>:
We created a Telegram channel [@kaicode](https://t.me/kaicode),
to share the news, which we have about
our events and the community we build.

The [first big event](/main-2020.html) is planned on the 5th of Sep, 2020. It is supposed
to get together at least 16 interesting open source project founders
and let them share their experience. The best one will get a donation
from Huawei (around $5,000).

<ins>22 Apr 2020</ins>:
[KaiCode](https://www.kaicode.org) is founded, to get together a community of open source
enthusiasts and help young/emerging projects find their way
to users and sponsors. KaiCode initiative is sponsored by
[Huawei](https://www.huawei.com).
