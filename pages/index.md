Kaicode is an annual open source festival,
started in [2015](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html).

This is how it works: First, you submit your open-source product to us. 
Then, our jury will review it. If your product wins, we give you 
a monetary reward and a laurel badge that you can attach to your 
[README file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).

In order to get into the competition, your product must be:

  * Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com)
  * Larger than 4,000 [SLOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code)
  * Older than 12 months

To win, your product must demonstrate the highest 
quality of code and development processes. 
In particular, the jury pays attention to the following (in no particular order):

  * Clean code
  * Design choices
  * [Coding convensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) control
  * [Static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)
  * [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
  * [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)
  * [Code coverage control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)
  * [Requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering)
  * Documentation
  * [Git branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
  * [Bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system) and [issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system) tracking
  * [Code reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) 
  * [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
  * [Releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
  * [Licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license)

It doesnâ€™t matter how popular your product is or what programming language you use.

We reserve the right to reject any product without explanation.
