The [first meetup](https://kaicode.timepad.ru/event/1340101/) will happen on the **16th of July** in Moscow.
We are thinking about the first guest. If you know someone
awesome with their own open source projects,
[send them](https://t.me/kaicode_org) our way.

We created a Telegram channel [@kaicode](https://t.me/kaicode),
to share the news, which we have about
our events and the community we build.

The [first big event](/main-2020.html) is planned on the 5th of Sep, 2020. It is supposed
to get together at least 16 interesting open source project founders
and let them share their experience. The best one will get a donation
from Huawei (around $5,000).
